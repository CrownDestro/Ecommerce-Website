# Ecommerce-Website

A mini UID project of a Men's Fashion Website.

**Presenting a comprehensive website for an online fashion store named "TrendSetGO."**

The Home page features a stylish navigation bar, captivating images, and engaging call-to-action buttons.

On the Contact page, users can interact via a well-designed form with input validation and a dark mode toggle switch for personalized experience.

Additionally, the Payment page offers a secure payment gateway with input validation for owner name, card number, and CVV, ensuring data integrity.

Integrated React and Node.js for login and sign up page.

It's worth noting that the integration of Node.js and React files with these HTML files would enhance functionality, enabling dynamic content rendering, server-side processing, and improved user interactivity. This integration would elevate the website's performance and provide a seamless shopping experience for users.
